<span class="doccomment">//! Transactions handling.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! This module contains everything related to the handling of transactions.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # Overview</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! From a thousand miles perspective, the process of including a transaction in the chain is as</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! follows:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - The transaction gets built, in other words the bytes that encode the transaction are</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! generated. This can be done for example through a UI, through an offchain worker, or other. A</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! transaction can be either signed (i.e. have a signature attached to it) or unsigned, depending</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! on the action to be performed. A balance transfer, for example, generally always requires a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! signature.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - The transaction is then processed by a node, generally the node that belongs to the author</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! of the transaction, where it is *validated* by passing it as parameter to a runtime entry</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! point. See the [`validate`] module for more info.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - If the validation process indicates that the transaction can be propagated, it is then sent</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! over the peer-to-peer network to other peers. Each node that receives the transaction</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! similarly validates it and relays it to its own peers.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - When a block is authored, the node that authors it picks from its pool of validated</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! transactions the ones to include in the block. The logic under which transactions are picked</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and their ordering depends on the output of the validation. The *body* of the newly-authored</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! block is made of (but not exclusively) the transactions that have been included in said block.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - When a node receives a new block, the transactions in the pool are re-validated against</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! this block. The validation function found in the runtime is expected to return an error if</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! the transaction in question is already present in the chain and should not be included again.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! ## About duplicate transactions</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! In practice, the vast majority of the time, a given transaction can only ever be inserted</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! once in a chain, as the vast majority of transactions include some sort of nonce in their</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! encoding. In other words, once a transaction has been included in a block, trying to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! re-validate that same transaction against that same block or any of its descendants will</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! return an error.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Once a transaction has been included in a block, it becomes known to everyone. If the runtime</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! *always* considered a certain transaction as valid, then this transaction could be repeatedly</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! included in the chain over and over again (and by anyone, since the transaction is public).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! On a higher level, the logic of such a transaction couldn&#39;t possibly make sense, as the reason</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! why transactions exist in the first place is to modify the state of the chain. In other words,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a runtime that always considers a certain transaction to be valid doesn&#39;t make sense on a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! higher level.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! With that in mind, a Substrate/Polkadot client implementation is allowed to make two</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! assumptions:</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - After a transaction has been included in a block, trying to re-validate it against that</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! same block or any of its descendants always yields an error.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! - The same transaction can&#39;t possibly be included twice in the same block.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &gt; **Note**: The official Substrate client, in particular, tracks transactions by their hash,</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &gt;           and removes from the pool any transaction from the pool after it has been included</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &gt;           in the best chain, without even attempting to re-validate it (but re-inserts</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &gt;           transactions in the pool if a block gets reverted).</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! However, this is in theory not the correct behaviour. A legitimate (but in practice very</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! uncommon) use-case for runtimes is to consider a transaction as invalid right after it has</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! been included, but then valid again some time in the future.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The specific use case is considered to be uncommon enough to not explicitly be taken into</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! account. The client considers that once a transaction has been considered invalid against a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! certain block B, it will forever remain considered as invalid on any descendant of B, but a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! client also attempts to not cache that information for *too long* through heuristics.</span>
